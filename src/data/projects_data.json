Whether it is during a visit at a museum or from the comfort of our home, the app lets us upload a picture of an artwork, scan the text on its cartel and retrieve related information. The idea behind this project came as I felt overwhelmed by the amount of photos in my phone gallery, not being able to easily access artworks I’ve liked and felt inspired by. This app is also a means to learn and discover art through the community.",
